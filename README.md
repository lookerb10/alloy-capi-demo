## üéØ Getting Started

### 1. Get Your Alloy Credentials (2 minutes)

You'll need two things from your Alloy account:

1. **API Key**: 
   - Go to [Alloy Dashboard](https://dashboard.runalloy.com)
   - Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí API Keys**
   - Create a new API key or copy an existing one

2. **User ID**:
   - In Alloy Dashboard, go to **Users**
   - Create a test user (or use an existing one)
   - Copy the User ID

### 2. Run the Demo

**Option A: Use the Hosted Version**

1. Visit: https://lookerb10.github.io/alloy-capi-demo/
2. Enter your API Key and User ID in the modal
3. Start exploring! Your credentials are saved for the session

**Option B: Run Locally**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lookerb10/alloy-capi-demo.git
cd alloy-capi-demo

# Open the HTML file in your browser
# No build step needed - it's a single HTML file!
open index.html
```

That's it! The demo is a single self-contained HTML file with no dependencies.

## üìñ How to Use the Demo

### Main Interface

#### 1. View Connections Button (Top Left)
- Shows a count badge of connected platforms
- Click to open the **Manage Connections** modal
- See all connected and available platforms
- Connect new platforms or manage existing connections

#### 2. API Inspector (Top Right)
- Tracks all API calls in real-time
- Click the header to expand/collapse
- Shows request bodies, response data, and timing
- Groups repetitive calls (like credential checks) to reduce noise
- Click "Clear History" to reset

#### 3. Credential Status Badges
- Every connector card shows its connection status:
  - **‚úì Connected** (green) - Ready to use
  - **üîê Not Connected** (gray) - Needs authentication
- Click any badge to open credential details modal

### Workflow: Connecting a Platform

1. **Find a connector** on the main grid
2. **Click the credential badge** or select the connector
3. **Follow the OAuth flow**:
   - Some platforms require additional info (like tenant ID)
   - A popup window will open for authentication
   - Authenticate in the popup
   - Return and click "I've Authenticated"
4. **Badge turns green** ‚úì - you're connected!

### Workflow: Executing an Action

1. **Select a connector** (must be connected first)
2. **Pick a resource** (e.g., "Contacts", "Companies")
3. **Choose an action** from the dropdown (e.g., "Create Contact")
4. **Fill in the form**:
   - Required fields are marked with red asterisks
   - Optional fields are in the expandable section
   - Use proper formats (dates, emails, etc.)
5. **Click "Create Record"** (or equivalent button)
6. **Watch the API Inspector** to see the request/response
7. **View results** - success message or error details

### Managing Credentials

#### From the Credential Modal:
- **üîç Test Connection** - Verify the credential works
- **üîÑ Reconnect** - Refresh the OAuth token
- **üóëÔ∏è Disconnect** - Remove the credential

#### From View Connections:
- See all connected platforms at once
- Connect new platforms without leaving the modal
- Quickly access credential details

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Single-File Design
This demo is intentionally built as a **single HTML file** with embedded CSS and JavaScript to make it:
- ‚úÖ Easy to understand and modify
- ‚úÖ Simple to deploy (just upload one file)
- ‚úÖ Perfect for learning (no build tools required)
- ‚úÖ Great for quick demos and prototypes

### Key Components

#### API Client (`makeAlloyApiCall`)
- Handles all HTTP requests to Alloy API
- Automatically adds authentication headers
- Tracks requests in the API Inspector
- Error handling with detailed messages

#### Schema Parser (`parseActionSchema`)
- **Recursive parsing** of nested object schemas
- Extracts path parameters from URLs
- Identifies required vs optional fields
- Handles arrays, objects, enums, and primitives

#### Form Generator (`displayActionForm`)
- Creates input fields based on schema types
- Handles nested objects with dot notation
- Supports dates, selects, textareas, numbers, emails
- Validates required fields before submission

#### Credential Manager
- Checks credentials for all connectors on load
- Groups credential status checks in API Inspector
- Manages OAuth flows with popup windows
- Handles platform-specific authentication requirements

```javascript
function getConfig() {
    return {
        apiKey: sessionStorage.getItem('alloy_api_key'),
        userId: sessionStorage.getItem('alloy_user_id'),
        baseUrl: 'https://production.runalloy.com'
    };
}
```

### Adding Custom Features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Considerations

**This demo is NOT production-ready.** It's designed for learning and prototyping. For production use, you'll need:

### Security (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Backend API proxy** - NEVER expose API keys in frontend code
- [ ] **Server-side credential storage** - Store credential IDs and user mappings securely
- [ ] **User authentication** - Implement proper auth (OAuth, JWT, sessions)
- [ ] **API key rotation** - Regular key rotation and secrets management
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse and API quota exhaustion
- [ ] **Input validation** - Sanitize all user inputs server-side
- [ ] **CORS configuration** - Proper origin restrictions

**Note:** Alloy securely stores the actual OAuth tokens and third-party credentials. You're responsible for:
1. Protecting your Alloy API key
2. Managing which users have access to which credential IDs
3. Storing the credential ID ‚Üí user mappings

### Architecture
- [ ] **Backend API layer** - Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.
- [ ] **Database** - Store users, credential mappings, integration metadata
- [ ] **Queue system** - Handle async operations (Bull, Sidekiq, etc.)
- [ ] **Webhook handling** - Listen for real-time updates from integrations
- [ ] **Error handling** - Retry logic, dead letter queues, alerting
- [ ] **Logging & monitoring** - Track usage, errors, performance
- [ ] **Caching** - Redis for connector lists, schemas, etc.

### User Experience
- [ ] **Custom UI/UX** - Design for your specific use case
- [ ] **Data transformation** - Map fields between your app and integrations
- [ ] **Validation rules** - Business logic specific to your domain
- [ ] **Onboarding flow** - Guide users through setup
- [ ] **Help documentation** - Explain what each integration does
- [ ] **Usage analytics** - Track which integrations are popular

### Compliance & Legal
- [ ] **Data privacy** - GDPR, CCPA compliance
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Track all integration activity
- [ ] **Terms of service** - Legal agreements with users
- [ ] **Data retention** - Policies for storing integration data
- [ ] **Security testing** - Penetration testing, vulnerability scans
